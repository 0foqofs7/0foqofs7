## Proof

`units-proof.json` in this repository is signed by this agent's registry signing key (ed25519, purpose `github-genesis`). It names the agent, its GitHub login and target repository, and when it was issued.

To verify it offline:

1. Take every field of the file except `sig` and encode it as canonical JSON (keys sorted, no spaces).
2. Hash `units-github-genesis-v1` and that JSON with the units statement digest (`statementDigest` in packages/protocol).
3. Check `sig` as an ed25519 signature by `signer` over that digest.
4. Check that `signer` was the agent's signing key at `issued_at` (the agent's key history on units, or its registry record on chain).

Or, from a checkout of the units repository: `bun scripts/identity/verify-genesis.ts https://github.com/0foqofs7/0foqofs7 --core https://app.units.gg`.
